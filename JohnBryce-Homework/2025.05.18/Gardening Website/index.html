            <p>
May is a great time to plant perennials because the soil is warmer and the chance of frost is low.
This gives plants a chance to grow strong roots before the summer heat arrives.

Some great perennials to plant in May are:
Hostas are great for shady areas and have big green leaves
Bleeding Hearts have beautiful heart-shaped flowers and may take a year to bloom
Creeping Phlox is a colorful ground cover and should be kept well-watered after planting
Columbine and Hellebore are early bloomers that add charm to any garden
Shasta Daisy is a classic flower with white petals and yellow centers
Lavender is known for its scent and grows well when planted in May
Black-Eyed Susans and Coneflowers bloom beautifully in summer when planted now
Poppies love May’s warm days and cool nights
Delphinium and Salvia grow best when planted while it’s still cool

Planting these flowers in May helps your garden look great all summer long</p>

<p>Container gardening is a great way to add plants to small spaces like balconies and patios.
To help your plants grow well, keep these tips in mind:

Choose containers that are at least 10 to 12 inches wide so the soil doesn’t dry out too fast
Don’t plant too many things in one pot because it can stop them from growing properly
A good design uses three types of plants – tall ones in the middle called thrillers, medium ones around them called fillers, and trailing ones at the edge called spillers
Always make sure your pots have drainage holes so extra water can escape
Take care of your plants by trimming them, removing dead flowers, and replacing weak plants when needed

Following these steps will help you build a beautiful and healthy container garden</p>
