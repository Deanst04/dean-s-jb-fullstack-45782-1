            <p>Programming languages are the tools developers use to communicate with computers and create software, websites, apps, and more.
Each language has its own syntax (rules) and purposeâ€”some are best for web development, others for data analysis, games, or mobile apps. Popular programming languages include Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and many others. These languages allow developers to give instructions to computers, solve problems, and build everything from small scripts to large systems. Just like humans use different spoken languages to communicate, programmers use coding languages to create the digital world around us.
